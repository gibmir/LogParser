##Logs are:
 * Written inputs "input from (filterMember: 4426 ..."
  And outputs "exit with (filterMember: 4426 ..."
 In different methods.
 * In the example: filterMember - the name of the method, 4426 - the ID of the specific call to the filterMember method.
### You need to write one class in Java 8 that would:
 *   - started from the command line,
 *   - received the input to the log file path,
 * ####  Output to the console summary for each method that hit the log:
    * Method name, minimum time, maximum time, average time, number of calls, ID of the longest call
